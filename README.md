# flask-blog
==============

This is my first Python GitHub repo for a test blog app in Flask. This is a proof of concept using Python and Flask. This should be exciting and fun!

This project allows a user to log into a secure portal and add a post. This post will write to a SQL server. Additionally, the server queries the SQL server and retuen those results to display on the main web page.
